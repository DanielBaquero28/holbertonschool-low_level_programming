<h1>Project: Bit Manipulation</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we will understand how bits work in a program and hopefully the best practices for optimization.</strong></p>
<body>
<li>Task 0: Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.</li>
<li>Task 1: Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.</li>
<li>Task 2: Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.</li>
<li>Task 3: Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.</li>
<li>Task 4: Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.</li>
<li>Task 5: Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.</li>
<li>Advanced Task 0: Write a function that checks the endianness.</li>
<li>Advanced Task 1: Find the password for a given program (Crackme Style)</li>
<li>Advanced Task 2: Write a blog post on how integers are stored in memory using twoâ€™s complement.</li>
