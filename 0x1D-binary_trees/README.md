<h1>Project: Binary Trees</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we will learn how about Binary Trees. What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree. What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists. What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree. What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree. What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree.</strong></p>

<li>Task 0: Write a function that creates a binary tree node.</li>
<li>Task 1: Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node.</li>
<li>Task 2: Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node.</li>
<li>Task 3: Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree.</li>
<li>Task 4: Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf.</li>
<li>Task 5: Write a function that checks if a given node is a root.</li>
<li>Task 6: Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal.</li>
<li>Task 7: Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal.</li>
<li>Task 8: Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal.</li>
<li>Task 9: Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree.</li>
